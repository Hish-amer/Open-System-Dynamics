This project is for a comprehensive open system simulator, with the end goal of simulating faithful device dynamics by capturing environmental effects and continuous control associated with complex experiments on real devices, specifically the superconducting devices of IBM and IQM. 

This project is driven by the personal need to overcome the difficulties of matching our current microsecond-long transmon-device experiments with less-involved simulators, a dependence that, past a certain circuit size, has translated to unfaithful predictions. This will include straightforward simulation of experiments like RB experiments and calibration protocols; will capture time dependent noise (for example 1/f dephasing noise common in superconducting devices) so both markovian and non-markovian effects; and will potentially be integrated with noise sectral density and device characterization protocols on IQM and IBM transmos devices.

Currently this is just a pilot code that I will be building up gradually, making sure to avoid the common coding project pitfalls common with physicists. This entails that I adhere to professional and best practices; starting with a convenient project structure; importable packages and modules; unit tests with pytest; benchmarking different functions for performance; weighing potential methods of vectorization, parallelization, dense vs sparse simulation, deterministic vs Monte-Carlo for quantum trajectory methods; and proper Github version control and CI (continuous integration).
